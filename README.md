# Modeling-Simulation-Optimization
###PROJECT 1:
This project has been focused on address on the real-time situation faced in optimizing the number of trains to be operated on HS2 railway lines running between London and Birmingham, considering the practical contraints. Linear Programming approach has been utilized develop the model to simulate the scenario and optimization has been done by utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation.

# Programming Language: Python
# Python Libraries : simpy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy.stats, scipy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model.


#### PROJECT 2: Review of Simulation Techniques Used To Predict Urban Development
This part of the report critically reviews the literature of simulation and modeling techniques used to simulate the urban sprawl of major cities and evolution. The techniques like multicriteria evaluation method (MCE), Cellular Automata (CA), Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Markov Chain Cellular Automata models has been studied at this part of the project.
