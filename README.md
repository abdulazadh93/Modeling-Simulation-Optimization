# Modeling-Simulation-Optimization
This project has been focused on address on the real-time situation faced in optimizing the number of trains to be operated on HS2 railway lines running between London and Birmingham. Linear Programming approach has been utilized develop the model to simulate the scenario and optimization has been done by utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation.
